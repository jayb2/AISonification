AI Sonification - Ribbit the game!

For the startup of this application just follow through the installer provided labled
setup and everything should be ready to go!

On startup of the application you will be presented with a start screen with some 
instructions in the middle, a play button at the top and a MIDI selector at the bottom.
YOU MUST select a MIDI output before playing the game, otherwise no sound will be heard.
If the MIDI output you selected is working you should here a note play and then a 
sequence start playing. The MIDI channels used for this application are 1 (piano) and
10 (drums) so make sure you have these setup properly.  

Once this is done you are ready to hit the play button. The controls for the game are
explained on the start screen but will also be here for an easy reference. 
D - Move one space right
A - Move one space left
E - Move two spaces right
Q - Move two spaces left
The E and Q keys can only be used sparingly so bare that in mind before using them!

Avoid the incoming logs with your frog (the fish won't hurt you!). If you get hit by a 
log your frog will die and you will have to exit the program and start again.
